# Udacity FSND project 1
## Portfolio Site

A simple and clean site that displays a portfolio, the design is based on [this PDF mockup](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf). 

### Usage

To show the site simply checkout the repository and open `index.html` with any web browser. 

Alternatively, the site can be served via a web server.
For a simple way of doing so, using **Python 2.7**, run the following command in the same directory as `index.html`:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then, with the browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
